Welcome 


This is my extinction app. It is designed to inform users of the current global extinction crisis affecting countless species on every major continent. This site will have a basic landing page where users will arrive and get basic information of what is happening to the various species inhabiting this planet. 


Feature included: 

*There will be an interactive page that informs the reader in greater detail in topics of their choice. 
*Users can share info via their social media. 
*If the user wishes to be more involved the site features links to other sites that want to preserve endangered species.
    *Users can log in and sign up for volunteer efforts to help causes they believe in 
    *Users will also be able to make donation via paypal


Technologies Used:

This app will be built via a MEAN stack.
User login will be authenticated and sessions maintained via JWT
User will be able to access their social media accounts and make donationg via paypal so authorization for each site will be needed and passport will be the way to achieve that.

Timeline:

Approach Taken: 
I started of with general features needed for the website. I focused a great deal of my initial project effort in creating the map. That was thru a simple google maps API. I got that working on Tuesday and from there I began actually building my app. After the map I turned my attention to the timeline which displays information of extinct species to users in a cool way. Once the timeline was operational I turned my attention to authorizing users. I am still in that process. 

Unsolved Problems/Hurdles: 
I spent a great deal of the first few days researching a small feature of the whole app. So I was unable to actually build anything that demonstrates the culmination of my time at GA. Major hurdles include JWT authorization. At the moment they are not going thru. And Time management and allocation of my stress free mind.
